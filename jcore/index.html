<h1>J2 open processor</h1>

<p>This page describes the <a href=http://0pf.org>open processor foundation</a>'s
<a href=http://0pf.org/j-core.html>j-core processor</a>, a clean-room open
source processor using the
<a href=http://www.shared-ptr.com/sh_insns.html>SuperH instruction set</a>,
implemented in VHDL and available royalty and patent free under [LINK]a BSD
license.</p>

<p>Specifically, this page explains how to build the processor's FPGA
bitstream and install it on a cheap (about $50) FPGA board, then how to
build, install, and boot Linux to a shell prompt with serial console.</p>

<p>The steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a Numato Mimas v2 FPGA board.</li>
<li>Download a bitstream (or build the processor yourself from source).</li>
<li>Flash bitstream into the board (via USB).</li>
<li>Download vmlinux (or build Linux yourself from source) and copy it to
the sdcard.</li>
<li>Boot board connected to a serial terminal (via same USB) to a Linux
shell prompt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is this processor?</h2>

<p>The current j-core generation, j2, is compatible with the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperH#SH-2>sh2</a> instruction set,
plus two backported sh3 barrel shift instructions (SHAD and SHLD) and a new
cmpxchg (mnemonic CAS Rm, Rn, @R0 opcode 0011-nnn-mmm-0001)
based on the IBM 360 instruction. Because it uses an existing instruction set,
Linux and gcc and such require only minor tweaking to support this
processor.</p>

<p>The developers gave a <a href=http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Turtles%20all%20the%20way.pdf>presentation</a> about it which was
<a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/647636/>covered by Linux Weekly News</a>.
Open source hardware can be manufactured cheaply (about 3 cents per
processor) audited for NSA backdoors or
<a href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/12/lenovo_firmware_nasty/>vendor
backdoors</a> or decade-old
<a href=http://hothardware.com/news/researchers-discover-rootkit-exploit-in-intel-processors-that-dates-back-to-1997>exploitable firmware bugs</a>,
and built without hidden extra processors in things like
<a href=http://s3.eurecom.fr/~zaddach/docs/Recon14_HDD.pdf>storage devices</a>
and <a href=http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/this-thumbdrive-hacks-computers-badusb-exploit-makes-devices-turn-evil/>USB controllers</a>
easily repurposed into spyware.</p>

<p>The j2 is a nommu processor because sh2 (the processor in the Sega Saturn
game console) was, and the last sh2 patent expired in October 2014.
The sh4 processor (dreamcast) has an mmu, but the last sh4 patents don't
exire until 2016.</p>

<p>The <a href=http://lists.nommu.org/mailman/listinfo/0pf>0pf mailing
list</a> is the best place for further information or to ask questions.</p>

<h1>Quick start on hardware</h1>

<p>The theory is you flash a "bitstream" file into an FPGA board's onboard
SPI flash, which configures the FPGA to act like a j2 processor. This
bitstream includes a small bootloader that attempts to load a file called
"vmlinux" from an sd card, containing a linux kernel with a filesystem
in initramfs configured to boot with a serial console.</p>

<p>To do this, you need an FPGA board and sdcard, a bitstream, a vmlinux
file with bundled initramfs, an sdcard writer, and a computer with a
USB connection (to write the SPI flash and connect to the serial console,
we used a laptop running Ubuntu 14.04).</p>

<h2>1) Get some hardware</h2>

<p>You probably want to start with a Numato board, but it's not the only
option:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Numato</b>:
The cheapest usable FPGA development board ($50 US) the j2 build system
currently targets is the
<a href=http://numato.com/fpga-boards/xilinx/spartan6/mimas-v2-spartan-6-fpga-development-board-with-ddr-sdram.html>Numato Mimas v2</a>
(also available <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Numato-Mimas-Spartan-Development-Board/dp/B00RL7FCQW>on amazon</a>).
It contains a Xlinux "Spartan 6" lx9 FPGA, 64 megs of SDRAM, USB2 mini-B,
and a micro-sd card slot.</p>

<p>You will probably also need a USB mini-B cable (the kind playstation
controllers use, not the kind android phones use), a
<a href=http://www.amazon.com/s/?keywords=usb+sd+card+adapter>USB sdcard
adapter</a>, and a blank micro-sd card. The Numato has a builtin USB serial
converer, so its "serial port" is already USB. (This USB port can also power
the board, and Numato provides a python script that writes
bitstreams to the onboard SPI flash through it.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Avnet</b>: Early j2 development was done on
<a href=http://www.em.avnet.com/s6microboard>Avnet Spartan-6 LX9 Microboard</a>
which which is more expensive (about $90) and doesn't have a builtin sd card
(although you can
<a href=http://numato.com/micro-sd-expansion-module.html>add one</a>).
That board is physically smaller and has builtin ethernet, so it's
potentially interesting as an "Internet of Things" platform, but the
Numato is a better starting board.</p>

<p><a href=https://tingcao.wordpress.com/category/lx9-microboard/>This blog</a>
has more information about using the Avnet board, including flashing
a bitstream onto it. (We used a digilent tool to flash it, and had to
modify its config files by hand to teach it about this board.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>SEI</b>: The 9 in lx9 means it has about 9000 programmable logic gates.
A minimally configured j2 processor (with no icache or dcache) takes up
about 6000[TODO verify] of those gates, and that's before you add SOC
peripherals like MMC or ethernet. At some point in the future,
<a href=http://se-instruments.com>SE Instruments</a> (which sponsored the
initial j-core development) intends to run a kickstarter to produce
a Raspberry-Pi form factor FPGA board based on the Xilinx lx45 (with about
7 times as many gates as an lx9) so people can play with SMP and adding
DSPs and so on. They'll announce it on the 0pf mailing
list when they get around to that.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>[TODO page on porting jcore build to new FPGA boards.]</p>

<p>The rest of this page describes using the Numato board.</p>

<h2>2) Get/install a bitstram.</h2>

<p>The point of open hardware is that you can build a bitstream
from the VHDL source code, but for your initial smoketesting you probably
want to [TODO LINK]grab a known working binary and install that first.</p>

<p>To build your own bitstream from VHDL source:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=bitcomp.html>Install the Xilinx
bitstream compiler</a></li>
<li><a href=http://landley.net/aboriginal/bin/cross-compiler-sh2elf.tar.gz>Install the sh2 bare metal compiler</a> (to build the ROM bootloader).
It doesn't require a specific install location, you can extract it into
your home directory if you like.</li>
<li>Download the bitstream source, either the current
<a href=http://0pf.org/?smd_process_download=1&download_id=491>release version</a> or
git clone [TODO LINK]</li>
<li>Enter xilinx context and add the cross-compiler-sh2elf/bin directory to
your $PATH so sh2elf-cc and friends are available, and cd into the bitstream
source directory.</li>
<li>Fix the toolchain prefix with: sed -i 's/sh2-elf-/sh2elf-/g' $(grep -rl sh2-elf- .)
[TODO: check this in]</li>
<li>Run "make mimas_v2". (Other targets are available under targets/boards.)</li>
<li>Your bitstream should wind up in output/*/numato.bin. [TODO: why the
date directory? That's not how package builds work, have output, overwrite
output when you rebuild. And make clean not deleting this? Really?]</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason the bare metal compiler is different from the
<a href=http://landley.net/aboriginal/bin/cross-compiler-sh2eb.tar.gz>sh2
Linux compiler</a> (other than not containing a C library) is different
function prefixes. Since low level code like the ROM bootloader (which runs
when the processor starts up and loads vmlinux off the sdcard) is written
in assembly, it manually refers to prefixed function names. Although there
is a command line option to change the prefixes, the compiler contains library
code (such as libgcc.a) that has to match the calling conventions of the
rest of the code.</p>

<h2>3) Flash the bitstream to the board.</h2>

<p>Numato
<a href=http://svn.numato.cc/svn/numatocc/FPGA/MimasV2Spartan6Dev/trunk/tools/configuration/python/MimasV2Config.py>provides</a> a GPL-licensed python3 tool
to <a href=http://svn.numato.cc/svn/numatocc/FPGA/ElbertV2Spartan3ADev/trunk/tools/configuration/python/readme.txt>flash bitstreams</a>
onto their board, but it has
<a href=https://numato.com/community/threads/solved-mimas-v2-programming-in-linux.15/>a bug</a> that prevents it from working on 64 bit systems, so
<a href=MimasV2Config.py>here</a> is a corrected version with the
bug corrected. [TODO: port to python 2]</p>

<p>To use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody ever has python 3 installed, so:
apt-get install python3 python3-serial</li>
<li>Flip the black switch on the board (between the VGA and USB ports)
towards the USB side. This is the "flash" position.</li>
<li>Connect the board to your Linux box with a USB mini-B cable. (The
kind playstation controlers use, not the kind android phones use.)</li>
<li>sudo python3 MimasV2Config.py /dev/ttyACM0 numato.bin</li>
<li>Flip the switch back towards the VGA side. This is the "boot" position.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above assumes the Numato serial port shows up as /dev/ttyACM0,
which is almost always the case.</p>

<h2>4) Hook up a serial console</h2>

<p>Nomato's serial port implementation only connected data send and receive
lines, meaning it doesn't provide hardware flow control. This confuses terminal
programs that expect RTS and CTS (let alone DTR or DSR). We can use the stty
tool to tell Linux not to care, then use a simple terminal program that
won't try to fiddle with this itself.</p>

<p>Since the /dev/ttyACM0 device goes away each time you unplug and
replug the USB cable (which conveniently power cycles the board),
we can combine these two commands into a single command line in the command
history. (So after you power cycle the board, cursor up and hit enter to
reconnect the serial terminal.)</p>

<ul>
<li>stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 -crtscts && ~/busybox-x86_64 microcom -s 115200 /dev/ttyACM0</li>
</ul>

<p>Even without a vmlinux image on the sdcard (or without an sdcard), a
successfully flashed processor should run its bootloader out of the same
flash, which says "CPU tests passed" and announces
its revision and build date before complaining it can't load vmlinux from the
sdcard. If it doesn't do this, you probably forgot to put the flash/run
switch back in the right position. (You have to power cycle the board
after doing that.)</p>

<h2>5) Install vmlinux on the sdcard</h2>

<p>Again, you can build linux source but for our first go at it, grab
the vmlinux image from <a href=http://0pf.org/?smd_process_download=1&download_id=548>the 0pf website</a>.</p>

<p>The file in question ends in .gz but wordpress tells your browser to
decompress it during the download, because wordpress. So ignore the gz
and copy the file as-is to the (vfat formatted) sdcard under the name
"vmlinux".</p>

<p>Stick the sdcard in the board, reboot, reconnect the serial console,
and login at the prompt (user root, password admin). Congratulations,
you have a Linux shell prompt on j2.</p>

<p>To build vmlinux from source:</p>

<p>[TODO]That's an old uclinux image, working on this in aboriginal linux
with current tools, kernel source posted to lkml it's getting nommu userspace
together that's fiddly. (It runs from initramfs so the root filesystem
is in the vmlinux image, hence rebuild requiring that as a prerequisite...)
