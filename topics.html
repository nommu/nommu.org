<h2>Stuff we need to cover</h2>
<pre>
- Why nommu?
  - very hard realtime (nanoseconds)
  - very low memory (XIP sram)
    - page tables take up memory, 4k page size
  - very low power
    - low transistor count
  - very cheap
  - because it's there
    - if you have one of these chips it's nice to have the option of running
      linux on it rather than being restricted to a less capable embedded OS
- Architectures
  - sh2, coldfire, blackfine, cortex-m, armv7r
- Distros
  - uclinux (RIP)
    - was based on uclibc and busybox
  - buildroot
  - openembedded
  - rolling your own
    - packages
      - linux
      - musl
      - toybox
- Programming
  - executable format (binflat, fdpic)
  - fixed stack
  - fork vs vfork
